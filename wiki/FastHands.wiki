== How To Use ==

Fast Hands is a tray icon application with a popup menu and hotkeys. Use the hotkeys while in-game to turn features on or off. Relies on the middle mouse button (Mouse3) as one of the hotkeys. You will need to set a location to where the items will be dragged before the mouse dragging macro can be activated.
